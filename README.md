# Universal wireless lighting control

There are many different communication standards available for home automation,
with regard to the physical communication link, as well as to the protocol.

Some of the more popular alternatives include:

* ZigBee
* Z-Wave
* Insteon
* Wi-Fi
* BLE
* RF24L01

There is also Souliss (http://souliss.net/), which does not really support
wireless, but relies on others to provide the physical networking layer.
